# Automatic_Ticket_classification
With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket to its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department.
